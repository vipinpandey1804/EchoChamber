# 🎮 Echo Chamber - Complete Game Guide

## 🎯 How to Win
**Objective**: Navigate the blue square (player) to the **green glowing exit** in each level.

- Reach the green exit portal to complete the level
- Click "Next Level" to progress to higher levels
- Aim for high scores by completing levels quickly with fewer wall hits

## 👻 Role of Echoes
Echoes are **strategic helpers** that can move the exit location:

### What Echoes Do:
- **Press Enter** to create a "helpful" echo at your current position
- Echoes replay your actions after a 3-8 tick delay
- When echoes activate (every 10 ticks), they can **relocate the green exit**
- Use echoes to move the exit closer to you if you're stuck

### Echo Types:
- **Helpful (Cyan)**: Creates breadcrumb trails, moves exit strategically
- **Chaotic (Magenta)**: Unpredictable behavior, random exit movement
- **Mirror (Yellow)**: Reflects your movements in opposite direction
- **Delayed (Orange)**: Builds up energy then releases

### Strategy:
- Create echoes near walls or dead ends
- Wait for echoes to activate and potentially move the exit
- Each echo gives +10 points to your score

## ❌ How to Lose the Game
**You lose when your score reaches 0:**

- **Red Mines (💣)**: Step on them to lose 50 points each
- **Wall Hits**: Lose 5 points per collision
- **Time Penalty**: Lose 1 point per tick
- **Game Over**: When score hits 0, you must restart the level

**Mine Details**:
- **Levels 1-5**: 1-2 mines (gradual introduction)
- **Level 6+**: 3+ mines (increases with each level, max 10)
- Appear as red glowing circles
- Cannot be avoided with Phase Shield
- Randomly placed in open maze areas

## 🏁 Maximum Level
**No hard maximum** - the game can theoretically continue indefinitely:

### Level Progression:
- **Level 1**: 7×7 maze (tutorial)
- **Level 2**: 10×10 maze 
- **Level 3**: 15×15 maze
- **Level 4**: 15×15 maze
- **Level 5**: 20×20 maze
- **Level 6+**: 25×25 maze (maximum size)

### Difficulty Scaling:
- Maze complexity increases with each level
- More walls and tighter passages
- Level 6+ maintains 25×25 size but could add new mechanics

## 🎮 Complete Controls Guide

### Movement:
- **↑ ↓ ← →**: Move one cell in any direction
- **Space**: Jump 2 cells forward in last movement direction
- **Enter**: Create a helpful echo at current position

### Power-Ups (Collect glowing circles):
- **⚡ Yellow**: Speed Boost - Move 2 cells at once
- **🛡️ Cyan**: Phase Shield - Walk through walls temporarily  
- **⏰ Blue**: Time Freeze - Pause echo replays

### Hazards (Avoid!):
- **💣 Red Mines**: -50 points each, can cause game over

## 📊 Scoring System
**Formula**: `Score = (100 - ticks) + (echoes × 10) - (wall_hits × 5) - (mine_hits × 50) + (score_bonuses)`

### Score Breakdown:
- **Start**: 100 points
- **Time Penalty**: -1 point per tick (game timer)
- **Echo Bonus**: +10 points per echo created
- **Wall Penalty**: -5 points per wall collision
- **Mine Penalty**: -50 points per mine hit
- **Score Bonuses**: +25 (coin), +50 (gem), +100 (star)
- **Game Over**: Score reaches 0

### High Score Tips:
1. Complete levels quickly (fewer ticks)
2. Use echoes strategically (bonus points + exit movement)
3. Avoid hitting walls (score penalty)
4. **AVOID RED MINES** (major score penalty)
5. **COLLECT SCORE BONUSES** (coins, gems, stars for extra points)
6. Collect power-ups for faster navigation

## 🏆 Winning Strategy

### Beginner Strategy:
1. Learn the maze layout first
2. Use arrow keys to navigate carefully
3. Hit walls to understand boundaries
4. Find the green exit and reach it

### Advanced Strategy:
1. **Speed Run**: Navigate directly to exit for high scores
2. **Mine Avoidance**: Plan routes carefully to avoid red mines
3. **Echo Mastery**: Use Enter key to create echoes that move the exit closer
4. **Score Collection**: Prioritize gold coins (+25), green gems (+50), pink stars (+100)
5. **Power-Up Collection**: Grab yellow/cyan/blue/magenta circles for abilities
6. **Wall Avoidance**: Plan routes to minimize wall hits

### Expert Tips:
- Use Space bar to jump over single walls
- **Carefully navigate around red mines** - they cause major score loss
- Create echoes in strategic positions to manipulate exit location
- Collect Phase Shield (cyan) to walk through walls temporarily
- Time Freeze (blue) stops echoes if they're moving exit away from you
- Monitor your score - hitting mines can quickly lead to game over
